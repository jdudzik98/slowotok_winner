# slowotok_winner

Script designed to help winning the popular polish online word game Słowotok (https://slowotok.pl). 
Using csv file with all possible words (https://sjp.pl/slownik/growy/) and inputted letters, script writes down list of 
possible words. Main problem is that game requires regular form of words, and script for now writes all possible forms. 
Although it can be used to win in Słowotok.
